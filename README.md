# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Android Development Task

Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This repository documents Task 4 of the internship, which focuses on building a Tic Tac Toe game app for Android.

## Task Overview

The objective of this task is to develop a Tic Tac Toe game app for Android where:
- Two players can take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.
- The game identifies a winner when a player forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their symbols.
- The app includes a reset option to start a new game.

## Steps

1. **Setup Project**:
   - Create a new Android project in Android Studio.
   - Configure project settings including project name, package name, and target SDK.

2. **Design UI**:
   - Implement the user interface for the Tic Tac Toe game using XML.
   - Include a `GridLayout` to display a 3x3 grid of buttons, each representing a cell in the Tic Tac Toe board.
   - Add a `Button` for resetting the game.

3. **Implement Logic**:
   - Write Java code in `MainActivity.java` to handle the game logic.
   - Implement the functionality to manage turns between players, check for a winner, and handle game resets.
   - Ensure that the game correctly identifies wins, ties, and invalid moves.

4. **Write Tests**:
   - Develop instrumented tests to verify the app’s functionality and correctness.
   - Create test cases to validate game play, win conditions, and the reset functionality.
   - Use Espresso for UI testing to ensure that the app behaves as expected under various scenarios.

5. **Build & Run**:
   - Compile the app using Android Studio and resolve any build issues.
   - Test the app on an Android device or emulator to ensure it operates as expected.
   - Verify that all functionalities work correctly and that the app handles user input gracefully.

## Knowledge Gained

- **Android Application Development**:
  - Gained practical experience in setting up and managing an Android app project.
  - Learned how to use Android Studio for development and debugging.

- **User Interface (UI) Design**:
  - Acquired skills in designing intuitive and functional user interfaces for mobile applications.
  - Implemented layouts using XML to create a user-friendly Tic Tac Toe game board.

- **Game Logic Implementation**:
  - Developed logic to manage game turns, detect win conditions, and handle game resets.
  - Implemented functionality to ensure accurate game play and user interaction.

- **Testing in Android**:
  - Developed skills in creating and executing instrumented tests using Espresso.
  - Ensured the app’s reliability and functionality through rigorous testing.

## Summary

This task involved the development of a Tic Tac Toe game app for Android, covering the following aspects:
- **Project Setup**: Configured and initialized an Android project.
- **UI Design**: Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface for the Tic Tac Toe game using XML.
- **Logic Implementation**: Developed the core game logic to manage turns, check for wins, and reset the game.
- **Testing**: Created and ran instrumented tests to validate the app’s functionality and correctness.

The provided instrumented tests confirm that the app’s context is correctly configured and that core functionalities are operational.

## Conclusion

The task successfully demonstrated the fundamental steps required to build a Tic Tac Toe game app for Android, including:
- Effective design and implementation of the user interface.
- Development of core game functionalities.
- Application of testing practices to ensure app reliability.
